# Fantom resource analyser

Hello everybody, this is my solution of Fantom task on CryptoBazar Serial Hacking:November.

The task was to create: *Resource analyser/predictor, given smart contract—as LLVM IR—predict compute resource usage (Ethereum analogy: gas usage)*

Main idea...

# How to test:
You will need clang and lli.
````
./run examples/fib.c
./run examples/parallel_fib.c
````

# Integration with Fantom smart contract IDE is coming soon...
